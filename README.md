There is more, but since those are limited due to `cough, cough`, Those will be post on a later day, They will be under C++ I, II and III. [Integrated]

## C++

a collection of leet code like questions, and some of math class stuff.

## Data Structure

## Java

For others, and for speed, now it's leet code

### redo

Like, really simple stuff that mostly for fun, or coded within 5-15 mins per stuff.
I have revisited these simple algorithms for the benefit of others, and to improve my speed on LeetCode. Initially, these were just practice exercises for my math class, but now they serve a dual purpose. Additionally, I am using them to assist someone else while simultaneously racing against a deadline for my Java codes.
